This is a course where we work on the different characteristics and peripherals that the microcontroller has and for this we will use the curiosity nano board with the PIC18F57Q43.
In this repository, the programs that will be explained in the blog will be accumulated in files, so I advise you to take a look at the blog https://edeelectronicasv.blogspot.com/ first.
